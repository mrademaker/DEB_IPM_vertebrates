This repository contains the supplementary information accompanying the manuscript 
"Why we should not necessarily expect life history strategies to inform on sensitivity to environmental change" Rademaker et al. (2022, in progress).
The repository consists of:

- [Data](Data) <br>
 -- A fully referenced version of the life history trait table (Table 1 in the manuscript), including computations to arrive at the reported values in the manuscript <br>
 -- Dataset to analyse relationship between population growth rate and reproductive strategy variables using additive modelling.<br>
 -- Dataset to analyse relationship between sensitivity and life history traits based on set of (non)linear correlation metrics.<br>
- [Script](Script) <br>
  -- The R-code used for additive modelling of the relationship between population growth rate and [reproductive strategy variables](GAM_strategy.r).<br>
  -- The R-code used for modelling the relationship between sensitivity and (non)linear correlation metrics.<br>
<br>
