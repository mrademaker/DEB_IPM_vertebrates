# DEB-IPM

This repository will contain the supplementary information accompanying the manuscript 
"Why we cannot always expect life history strategies to directly inform on sensitivity to environmental change" Rademaker et al. (2022, in progress).
The repository consists of:

- [Data](Data) <br>
 -- Dataset with species traits used in DEB-IPM (also in manuscript table).
 -- Dataset to analyse relationship between sensitivity and life history traits based on set of (non)linear correlation metrics.<br>
- [Script](Script) <br>
  -- The R-code used for performing phylogenetically informed PCA analysis.<br>
  -- The Matlab code for modelling population responses using DEB-IPM.
