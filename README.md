This repository contains the supplementary information accompanying the manuscript 
"Why we cannot always expect life history strategies to directly inform on sensitivity to environmental change" Rademaker et al. (2022, in progress).
The repository consists of:

- [Data](Data) <br>
 -- Dataset to analyse relationship between population growth rate and reproductive strategy variables using [additive modelling](Data/GAM_table.csv).<br>
 -- Dataset to analyse relationship between sensitivity and life history traits based on set of (non)linear [correlation metrics](Data/varrank_table_Table_1.csv).<br>
- [Script](Script) <br>
  -- The R-code used for modelling the relationship between sensitivity and (non)linear [correlation metrics](Script/sensitivity_trait_relations.R).<br>
